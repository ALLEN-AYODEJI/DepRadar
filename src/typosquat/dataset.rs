//! Bundled lists of popular npm and PyPI package names.
//!
//! Typosquatting attacks work by publishing a package whose name is one edit
//! away from something popular (`reqeusts`, `expresss`, `lodahs`). Detecting
//! that needs a reference set of "names worth imitating" to compare against.
//! This module ships that reference set as two JSON arrays under
//! `data/popular-packages/` and exposes a single loader that returns them as
//! one combined list.
//!
//! The lists are a hand-curated, representative snapshot of widely-used
//! packages — not a live-fetched ranking. Refreshing them from the registries'
//! real download stats is a later task; nothing here depends on the exact
//! ordering or count.
